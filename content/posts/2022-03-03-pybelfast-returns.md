## Talks:

### Comic Books, Open Source, & GraphQL
by [Kyle Harrison (@apoclyps)](https://github.com/apoclyps)

Ever think to yourself that a better product or service must exist but you failed to find one? Solving a real problem with technology can often be time-consuming when you first have to go build it. Yet building an MVP in a weekend is an achievable goal when the focus is maintained on the core problem. In this talk, Kyle will explore a solution to how you too can enjoy your comic book collection using a mix of open-source tech and GraphQL.

### Introduction to Geospatial Graph Networks with OSMNX
by [Andrew Bolster (@bolster)](https://github.com/andrewbolster)

While we’re used to thinking of maps and charts as being two-dimensional representations of reality, an alternative approach is to view maps as a graph of vertices (locations) and edges (roads or paths). Using the `osnmx` library, we’re going to do a short introduction to acquiring, manipulating, analysing, and plotting this stranger perspective on the world around us.

> May include lasers.

### How (not) to lie with data visualisation
by Curtis Wilson

Human brains are hard-wired to derive insights from what we see. Whenever we make a graph or chart or infographic we are trying to trick this system into understanding much more abstract information than “that apple looks good to eat” or “that tiger thinks I look good to eat”. A little insight into how our sense of sight works can help us create visualisations that express the underlying data as accurately as possible (or not, as the case may be).
