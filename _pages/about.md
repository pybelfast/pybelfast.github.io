## What is pyBelfast?
pyBelfast is a group of people who use Python in their work or personal
programming projects and like to meet and talk about it.

## When do you meet?
We try and meet bi-monthly however this varies. We keep a
[meetup](http://www.meetup.com/pybelfast/) page for definitive information.

## Can anyone talk?
Yes we encourage people to talk. Drop by the slack channel and let us know, we
are a very welcoming bunch.

## You mentioned a slack channel?
Pop into the [NI Tech & Design](http://nitech.herokuapp.com/) user group and
join the `#pybelfast` group. Just say 'hi!'.

## Organisers

McCullough](http://www.twitter.com/theonlyswmcc) are the organisers, you can find them
on the slack channel.
